## 🧹 **Data Cleaning Process**

**Tool:** Python (Pandas)

**Key Steps:**

* ✅ Converted `Date` column to datetime format
* ✅ Removed duplicate entries
* ✅ Handled missing values:

  * `Orders` & `Revenue` → Filled with `0`
  * `Customer Rating` → Replaced with column average
* ✅ Added calculated metrics:

  * **Conversion Rate** = Orders ÷ Website Visits
  * **Average Order Value (AOV)** = Revenue ÷ Orders
